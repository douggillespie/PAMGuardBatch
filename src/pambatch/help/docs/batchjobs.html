	<h2>Creating Batch Jobs</h2>
	<br>
	<p>Before you start processing, you need to set up one or more "jobs". Each job requires the name
	of a folder containing raw sound input data, the name of an output folder for binary data and
	the name of a database. </p>
	<p>The information about each job is stored in a table called Batch_processing.</p>
	
	
	<h3>Setting up single jobs</h3>
	<p>To set up a single batch job, click on "Create Job" and a dialog will appear where you can enter
	the folder for source sound files, the name of the output binary folder and the name of the output
	database. </p>
		
	<h3>Setting up multiple jobs</h3>
	<p>If all of your raw data are in multiple folders on the same hard drive, then it's easy to set up multiple
	jobs at once. Click the "Create Set" button and select the folder that contains sub folders for each set of
	data. The files within the sub folders will be searched for sound files to see how many jobs to create. Then 
	select a root folder for databases and a root folder for binary file output. The jobs will then be automatically
	created with output binary folder names and database names based on the names of the sub folders containing 
	the raw data. 
	
	<h3>Deleting Jobs</h3>
	<p>Created jobs will all appear in the main table in the lower half of the display. You can delete
	a job by right clicking on it and selecting "Delete Job" from the dropdown menu. </p>
	<p>If you want to delete multiple jobs, it's sometimes easier to close PAMGuard and delete jobs from the 
	BatchJobs table.</p>
	
	<h3>Editing jobs</h3>
	<p>Individual jobs can be edited by right clicking on a line in the main jobs table.</p>
