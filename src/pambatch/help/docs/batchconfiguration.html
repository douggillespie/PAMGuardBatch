	<h1>Batch Processing</h1>
	<h2>Batch Processor Configuration</h2>
	<br>
	<p>
		Whether you are planning to run jobs in <a
			href="_mainHelp_overview/PamMasterHelp/docs/normalMode.html">Normal
			Mode</a> to process raw data, or whether you plan to use <a
			href="_mainHelp_overview/overview/PamMasterHelp/docs/viewerMode.html">Viewer
			Mode</a> to run tasks on processed data, the Batch Processor module
		always runs in <a
			href="_mainHelp_overview/PamMasterHelp/docs/normalMode.html">Normal
			Mode</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
		To configure the batch processor, start PAMGuard in <a
			href="_mainHelp_overview/PamMasterHelp/docs/normalMode.html">normal
			mode</a> with a new / blank configuration and add two modules: a <a
			href="_mainHelp_utilities/generalDatabaseHelp/docsdatabase_database.html">database</a>
		and the batch processor module.
	</p>
	<p>
		No other modules should be added to the configuration, except perhaps
		a <a href="_mainHelp_utilities/userInputHelp/docs/userinput.html">User
			Input</a> module which would allow you to make notes about what you've
		been doing with the batch processor.
	</p>
	<p>On no account should you add any Sound Processing, or Detection,
		Classification, or Localisation modules to this configuration which
		should now look something like the image below.</p>
	<br>
	<img src="images/batch_empty.png" width="900">
	<br>
	<br>
	<h3>Select Operation Mode</h3>
	<p>In the top left "Job Control" panel select either "Raw data
		processing (normal mode)" or "Offline tasks (viewer mode)" from the
		drop-down menu. When you change this selection you'll notice that the
		display panels below change slightly reflecting the different
		available options for each operation mode.</p>


	<h3>Detector Configuration</h3>
	<p>The detectors and other sound processing you want to perform on
		your data are all controlled from the Configuration panel at the top
		of the display. Here, you select the configuration file that you want
		to use to process all of your different batch jobs with exactly the
		same settings.</p>
	<p>The most common thing to do, is to take a configuration file
		that you are already happy with, and have tested on some of the data,
		and select that configuration using the Browse button, however, you
		can also use the Browse button to create an empty configuration to
		work with andn then add the modules you require.</p>
	<p>To view or modify the configuration, press "Launch
		Configuration". This will open the configuration in a separate
		PAMGuard window where you can view and modify any of the sound
		processing and detector settings.</p>
	<p>Don't worry about which folder of sound files, database, and
		binary store are set in the configuration. These will all be
		overwritten with new values for each job when it runs.</p>
	<p>
		<b>Remember to save the configuration when you've made
			modification, or the changes may not get used when you come to
			process new data</b>
	</p>

	<h3>Viewer Task Configuration</h3>
	<p>Configuring offline tasks, such as re-running click
		classification, for Viewer mode is a bit more complicated than for the
		normal mode data processing. This is because each Viewer database
		already contains a copy of the configuration and the multiple
		databases and accompanying binary data may all have different
		configurations.</p>
	<p>To address this, as with the normal mode processing, you'll use
		a psfx file to hold a master configuration for the tasks you want to
		run. As each task runs, the batch processor will check the
		configuration in the dataset about to be processed and will do its
		best to ensure that the configuration for the dataset is compatible
		with the task to run:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>If the PAMGuard module required for the task is not present,
			the module will be added to the datasets configuration.</li>
		<li>The configuration settings for that module will all be copied
			over from the psfx configuration irrespective of whether the module
			was already present, or if it was just added.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>If the configurations differ considerably, there is no guarantee
		that the offline tasks will run correctly. For example if you were
		starting with two similar configurations, both of which had a click
		detector, but one was called "Click Detector" and the other
		configuration had called it "HF Click Detector" you'll not be able to
		use the same batch job configuration.</p>

	<h4>Extracting an existing Viewer configuration into a psfx file</h4>
	<p>It's possible that you have some PAMGuard datasets, each
		consisting of a database and a folder of binary data, but no longer
		have the psfx file used to generate those datasets. There are three
		ways in which you can quite easily recreate the psfx file to use with
		the batch processor:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Look in the folders of binary data. Each time PAMGuard starts
			it copies the psfx configuration into the first binary folder it
			generates. So the binary folders should contain an exact copy of the
			configuration used to generate that dataset.</li>
		<li>Open one of your datasets in Viewer Mode, then from the file
			menu select the option <em>Export Configuration ...</em> and save the
			configuration somewhere on your system.
		</li>
		<li>Generate your list of jobs you're going to run the tasks on,
			right click on any of the jobs in the "Job Detail table" and select
			the menu item <em>Extract Configuration from database ...</em> which
			will allow you to save the configuration in psfx format.
		</li>
	</ol>

	<h4>Adding new modules</h4>
	<p>
		Offline tasks can have entirely new modules added and will process
		their offline tasks so long as the module would not normally work on
		raw input data. For instance, if you added a new <a
			href="_mainHelp_detectors/clickDetectorHelp/docs/ClickDetector_clickDetector.html">Click
			Detector</a> at this stage, nothing will happen because the click
		detector expects to process raw data. Your could however add a <a
			href="_mainHelp_detectors/ClickTrainDetector/docs/ClickTrainDetector.html">Click
			Train Detector</a> to an existing configuration and it will search
		existing click detector output for click trains. Next time you open
		the datasets you processed with the additional detector you'll find
		it's added to the configuration and that the database has tables of
		detected click trains.
	</p>

	<h4>Tasks list</h4>
	<p>A list of available tasks will automatically be extracted from
		the master psfx file and displayed in the Offline tasks table in the
		lower half of the display. The list will reflect tasks available in
		the configuration you're working with. In this example the
		configuration has two click detectors, each of which has four standard
		tasks (click classification, echo detection, delay calculation, and
		bearing calculation). A <a href="_mainHelp_detectors/ClickTrainDetector/docs/ClickTrainDetector.html">Click Train Detector</a> module, which has two
		offline tasks for detection and classification, is connected to the
		output of the Minke Pulse Detector and an 
		<a href="_mainHelp_utilities/Alarms/docs/Alarms_Overview.html">Alarm module</a> to the output
		of the SoundTrap Click Detector. The task panel therefore contains a
		total of 11 different tasks.</p>

	<img src="images/tasktable.png" width="900">

	<p>For each task, the table shows the PAMGuard module running the
		tasks, the name of the task, the input to the task and which data are
		modified by the task. There is also a column where you select which
		tasks you want to run (it probably won't be all of them) and a button
		for editing settings if they are available.</p>

	<h4>Changing task settings</h4>
	<p>There are two ways of changing the task settings.
	<p>
	<ol>
		<li>Open the psfx file from the Configuration panel and change
			the settings there. Again <b> remember to save the configuration
				or the changes will not get used.</b>
		</li>
		<li>On the Offline tasks table, click on the button to the right
			of each task "Configure Task" and the settings for that task should
			show in a popup dialog. Once the dialog is closed, the settings will
			be applied to all jobs (apart from any already running).</li>
	</ol>
