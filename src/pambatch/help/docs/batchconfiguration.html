	<h1>Batch Processing</h1>
	<h2>Batch Processor Configuration</h2>
	<br>
	<p>
		Whether you are planning to run jobs in <a href="_mainHelp_overview/PamMasterHelp/docs/normalMode.html">Normal
			Mode</a> to process raw data, or whether you plan to use
			<a href="_mainHelp_overview/overview/PamMasterHelp/docs/viewerMode.html">Viewer
			Mode</a> to run tasks on processed data, the Batch Processor module always
			runs in <a href="_mainHelp_overview/PamMasterHelp/docs/normalMode.html">Normal
			Mode</a></p>
		<p>To configure the batch processor, start PAMGuard in <a
			href="_mainHelp_overview/PamMasterHelp/docs/normalMode.html">normal
			mode</a> with a new / blank configuration and add two modules: a <a
			href="_mainHelp_utilities/generalDatabaseHelp/docsdatabase_database.html">database</a>
		and the batch processor module.
	</p>
	<p>
		No other modules should be added to the configuration, except perhaps
		a <a href="_mainHelp_utilities/userInputHelp/docs/userinput.html">User
			Input</a> module which would allow you to make notes about what you've
		been doing with the batch processor.</p>
	<p>On now account should you add any Sound Processing, or
		Detection, Classification, or Localisation modules to this
		configuration which should now look something like the image below.</p>

	<h3>Select Operation Mode</h3>
	<p>In the top left "Job Control" panel select either "Raw data processing (normal mode)"
	or "Offline tasks (viewer mode)" from the drop-down menu. When you change this selection you'll notice
	that the display panels below change slightly reflecting the different available options for each operation mode. </p>
	
	
	<h3>Detector Configuration</h3>
	<p>The detectors and other sound processing you want to perform on
		your data are all controlled from the Configuration panel at the top
		of the display.</p>
	<p>The most common thing to do, is to take a configuration file
		that you are already happy with, and have tested on some of the data,
		and select that configuration using the Browse button, however, you
		can also use the Browse button to create an empty configuration to
		work with.	</p>
	<p>To view or modify the configuration, press "Launch
		Configuration". This will open the configuration in a separate
		PAMGuard window where you can view and modify any of the sound
		processing and detector settings.</p>
	<p>Don't worry about which folder of sound files, database, and
		binary store are set in the configuration. These will all be
		overwritten with new values for each job when it runs.</p>
	<p>
		<b>Remember to save the configuration when you've made
			modification, or the changes may not get used when you come to
			process new data</b>
