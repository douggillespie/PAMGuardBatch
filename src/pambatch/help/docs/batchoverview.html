	<h1>Batch Processing</h1>
	<h2>Overview</h2>
	<br>

	<p>The Batch Processing module can be used to run the same configuration file on multiple datasets sing the same psfx file
	without having to go into the configuration for every dataset to change the location of the source files, the output
	database name, and the location of the binary store. </p>
	<p>It is particularly useful for processing datasets from deployments of multiple autonomous recorders, but also has application
	in reprocessing of any data where you want to run the same PAMGuard algorithms on multiple sets of data.</p>
	<p>Currently, it can only be used to process raw data files in 
	<a href="_mainHelp_overview/PamMasterHelp/docs/normalMode.html">normal mode</a>. We are currently developing a 
	version that can run <a href="_mainHelp_overview/overview/PamMasterHelp/docs/viewerMode.html">viewer mode tasks</a> on multiple datasets, such as
        <a href="_mainHelp_detectors/clickDetectorHelp/docs/ClickDetector_clickClassification.html">reclassifying 
        clicks</a>, or running the  
        <a href="_mainHelp_detectors/ClickTrainDetector/docs/ClickTrainDetector.html">click train detector</a>.
	
	<h3>Installation</h3>
	<p>The batch processing module is a 
	<a href="https://www.pamguard.org/pluginmodules.html">plugin module</a>, which needs to be added to your PAMGuard installation</p>
	<p>If you're reading this in the PAMGUard online help, you've already installed the Batch Processing module.</p>
	<p>Otherwise, you need to download the latest jar file (e.g. PamguardBatch_1.6.jar) by following links from the
	PAMGuard plugins pages, then copy the jar file into your plugins folder (e.g. C:\Program Files\Pamguard\plugins) from where
	PAMGuard will automatically add it to the list of available modules in the Utilities menu next time it starts.</p>
