	<h1>Batch Processing</h1>
	<br>
	<p>The Batch Processing module can be used to run the same configuration file on multiple datasets sing the same psfx file. </p>
	<h2>Instructions:</h2>
<p>1.	Make a configuration you’re happy with which works on one dataset. 
<p>2.	Close it and put to one side. 
<p>3.	Make a new configuration containing just a database and the batch processing module. 
<p>4.	Near the top, select the configuration file you made earlier
<p>5.	Create individual jobs, or  a set of jobs (easier when you’ve a nice folder structure with a sub folder per set of raw data). 
<p>6.	Set it to run 2 or 3 jobs at a time (depends on your computer) Start at 2 and if the computer isn’t sweating you can increase it to 3 when it’s going. Any more has little gain since it all just slows down. You right click on the list of machines (there is only the one) to do this. 
<p>7.	Press the normal start button on the batch config and it will launch jobs. For each it will use the same psfx file, but will overwrite the input folder and the binary and database outputs. Note that it only works for folder analysis.
