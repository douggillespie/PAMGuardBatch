	<h2>Batch Processing</h2>
	<br>

	<p>The Batch Processing module can be used to run the same configuration file on multiple datasets sing the same psfx file
	without having to go into the configuration for every dataset to change the location of the source files, the output
	database name, and the location of the binary store. </p>
	<p>It is particularly useful for processing datasets from deployments of multiple autonomous recorders, but also has application
	in reprocessing of any data where you want to run the same PAMGuard algorithms on multiple sets of data.</p>
	<p>Currently, it can only be used to process raw data files in 
	<a href="_mainHelp_overview/PamMasterHelp/docs/normalMode.html">normal mode</a>. We are currently developing a 
	version that can run <a href="_mainHelp_overview/overview/PamMasterHelp/docs/viewerMode.html">viewer mode tasks</a> on multiple datasets, such as
        <a href="_mainHelp_detectors/clickDetectorHelp/docs/ClickDetector_clickClassification.html">reclassifying 
        clicks</a>, or running the  
        <a href="_mainHelp_detectors/ClickTrainDetector/docs/ClickTrainDetector.html">click train detector</a>.
	
	<h3>Installation</h3>
	<p>The batch processing module is a 
	<a href="https://www.pamguard.org/pluginmodules.html">plugin module</a>, which needs to be added to your PAMGuard installation</p>
	<p>If you're reading this in the PAMGUard online help, you've already installed the Batch Processing module.</p>
	<p>Otherwise, you need to download the latest jar file (e.g. PamguardBatch_1.6.jar) by following links from the
	PAMGuard plugins pages, then copy the jar file into your plugins folder (e.g. C:\Program Files\Pamguard\plugins) from where
	PAMGuard will automatically add it to the list of available modules in the Utilities menu next time it starts.</p>

	<h2>Instructions:</h2>
<p>1.	Make a configuration you're happy with which works on one dataset. 
<p>2.	Close it and put to one side. 
<p>3.	Make a new configuration containing just a database and the batch processing module. 
<p>4.	Near the top, select the configuration file you made earlier
<p>5.	Create individual jobs, or  a set of jobs (easier when you've a nice folder structure with a sub folder per set of raw data). 
<p>6.	Set it to run 2 or 3 jobs at a time (depends on your computer) Start at 2 and if the computer isn�t sweating you can increase it to 3 when it�s going. Any more has little gain since it all just slows down. You right click on the list of machines (there is only the one) to do this. 
<p>7.	Press the normal start button on the batch config and it will launch jobs. For each it will use the same psfx file, but will overwrite the input folder and the binary and database outputs. Note that it only works for folder analysis.
